## Inspiration

We live in an age where misinformation spreads faster than truth. From viral TikTok clips to politically charged tweets and WhatsApp forwards, it’s becoming harder to tell fact from fiction. We wanted to build something *fast*, *familiar*, and *frictionless* — a tool that doesn’t feel like “another fact-checking site,” but like texting a friend who’s always right.

Thus, **TruthCheck AI** was born:  
A Gen Z-friendly, chat-based AI assistant that tells you if that “news” you just saw is actually real — with reasoning and sources.

---

## What It Does

TruthCheck AI is an **AI-powered real-time fact-checking assistant** that:

- Accepts any text input — tweet, headline, message, or quote
- Uses **Google’s Gemini 2.0** to verify the claim
- Responds in a clean **chat format**
- Provides:
  - **Verdict**
  - **Reasoning**
  - **Sources**
